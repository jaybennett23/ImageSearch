## About

The project uses the Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/) API to show images relating to entered text. 

The app is built using an MVVM architecture and UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource has been used.

Unit tests have beeen added and very minor UI Tests wrote in XCUITest have too.

## Notes

The app could probably benefit from further unit testing (e.g. testing the networking layer) and further abstracting the NetworkManager but since I haven't touched the project in a while and have moved onto others it is unlikely they will be added in the near future.
